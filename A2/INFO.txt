Discussion:
	There are two scenarios that can arise when using this monitor: finite amount of cars for infinite amount of cars. In the first
	scenario if there is a finite amount of cars starvation is impossible. Consider the scenario that a car in the north wants to cross 
	but is unable to due the cars in other lanes. Since there are finite cars the other lanes will run out eventually leaving the quadrant 
	locks free for the north lane. Thus starvation cannot happen. As for the second scenario, and the more realistic one for busy cities,
	starvation is indeed possible. Consider the same example but imagine an infinite amount cars arriving in the other lanes, since the quadrant 
	locks dont have a preferrence of who retrieves them it is possible that the other lanes will be given priority and the north lane will left 
	without any locks to proceed. Since there are an infinite amount of cars the north car will never be able to cross, thus starvation.
